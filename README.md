# ATG_tasks Banao Flutter


This is a Flutter project that I created as part of a task from Banao Flutter. The task had two rounds: in the first round, I had to create a UI for an education app, and in the second round, I had to show data from a given API.

The UI that I created is a simple but functional design that includes a home screen, a list of courses, and a details screen for each course. The data that I displayed from the API is a list of courses, including the course name, the course description,number of lessons and the course duration.

I used the following technologies in this project:

Flutter,
Dart,
Dummy API
